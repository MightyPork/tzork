# TZork, your world clock

TZork lives at [tzork.com](http://tzork.com).

## What is TZork

TZork is a tool for tracking time in different timezones.

It can be used to track local time of your friends, check US time when you're
waiting for a NASA / Space-X launch, or just for fun check time is in other countries.

The project is open source, contributions are welcome!

## What's left to do

### Small tweaks

- [x] Option to show 12-hour time
- [x] Cache resolved timezones in `localStorage`, to avoid repeated Google API calls.
- [ ] Option to disable shadows? (for black on white theme)

### User interface

- [ ] Menu to select active profile
- [ ] About page of some sort, explaining Tzork and linking to GitHub
- [ ] More user friendly config GUI

### Backend stuff

- [ ] User accounts, saving Tzorks on the server (local saving can still work)
- [ ] Public Tzorks, shared with an URL (or Tzork config embedded *within* the URL?)
- [ ] Sharing Tzork ownership by multiple users? (maybe)

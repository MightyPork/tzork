# TZork, your world clock

TZork lives at [tzork.com](http://tzork.com).

## What is TZork

TZork is a tool for tracking time in different timezones.

It can be used to track local time of your friends, check US time when you're
waiting for a NASA / Space-X launch, or just for fun check time is in other countries.

The project is open source, contributions are welcome!

## What's left to do

- [x] A way to show more names in one timezone
- [x] Support for timezone aliases
- [ ] Do not rebuild existing bullets and people - move them! (if unchanged)
- [ ] An interface for adding, removing and editing names, timezones and colors (`people` array)
- [ ] Saving the `people` array in `localStorage` (and loading it)
- [ ] Rewrite the clock into SVG using Raphael.js (or other lib?)
- [ ] Themes :D
